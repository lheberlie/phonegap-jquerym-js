BACKGROUND:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the default directory used by this grunt template for storing HAR (HTTP Archive) files.
The grunt-manifest task supports reading the network waterfall (or dump) of the files requested by
your web application.

SAVING YOUR NETWORK TRAFFIC:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Google Chrome as your web browser, you can utilize the DevTools Network tab to save the network data.

https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/network#saving_network_data

Saving network data

You can save the data from a network recording as a HAR (HTTP Archive) file, or copy the records as a HAR data structure to your clipboard. A HAR file contains a JSON data structure that describes the network "waterfall". Several third-party tools can reconstruct the network waterfall from the data in the HAR file.

To save a recording:

Right+click or Control+click on the Network table.
In the context menu that appears, choose one of the following actions:
Copy All as HAR — Copies the network recording to the system clipboard in the HAR format.
Save as HAR with Content — Saves all network data to a HAR file along with each page resource. Binary resources, including images, are encoded as Base64-encoded text.
For more information, Web Performance Power Tool: HTTP Archive (HAR).


USING THE HAR FILE AS INPUT TO YOUR MANIFEST FILE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save your HAR file to this directory.

Specify the name of the HAR file in the Gruntfile.js within your project.
Look for the  // grunt-manifest section.

Search for the following line below:
There will be one for the build and one for distribution (dist).

networkHTTPArchive: "<%= pkg.networkArchiveDirectory %>/dist.har",

Some background on the grunt-manifest module:
The module searches the HAR file and pulls out the lines where it matches a URL,
such as the {"url": "http://foo.bar.baz/"} entries from the HTTP Archive (HAR).
It also performs a second match to NOT include any Esri REST service urls such as 
any of the URLs that serve geocoding, analysis, routing, geoenrichment, or 
host.arcgisonline.suffix urls.  If you want to change this behavior, you will need to
modify the Regular Expressions in the grunt-manifest.  See lines 91-92:

https://github.com/lheberlie/grunt-manifest/blob/develop/tasks/manifest.js#L92

WHEN THE GRUNT TASKS COMPLETE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you run the Grunt task for build or dist a manifest file will be generated.
Below is an example of what your manifest might look like after parsing a HAR file.
